a. You are a senior software developer. You have been tasked with creating a personal website. you will create 5 pages in total, your output should be in html and use css for styling. start with the index page here.

b. You are a senior software developer. You have been tasked with creating a personal website. you will create 5 pages in total, your output should be in html and use css for styling. work on the about page here. navigation across all pagers using a navigation bar should be consistent across all pages. 

c. You are a senior software developer. You have been tasked with creating a personal website. you will create 5 pages in total, your output should be in html and use css for styling. work on the contact page here. navigation across all pagers using a navigation bar should be consistent across all pages. This page should also contain a form. 

Add a form on the contact.html page. - Fields: - First Name (required) - Last Name (required) - Email
Address (required, valid format) - Password (required, min 8 characters) - Confirm Password (required,
must match Password) - Use attributes: required, type, pattern, minlength. - Show clear error messages
(using HTML or minimal JavaScript). - Redirect to a Thank You page (thankyou.html) after submission. -
Accessibility requirement: All inputs must have labels connected with for and id. Add alt text for any
images.

complete the creation of the thank you page as well. 

2. Output 

The AI assistant was used to generate the HTML and CSS for all five pages of the personal website, including index, about, projects, resume, contact, and thank you pages. Each page was created with a consistent navigation bar and modern styling. The contact page included a form with validation and accessibility features, and the thank you page was generated as a follow-up. All outputs were reviewed and checked for correctness, accessibility, and usability before acceptance.

3. Accepted, modified, or rejected output

Most of the AI-generated output was accepted with minimal modification. In some cases, minor adjustments were made to ensure accessibility (such as label associations and alt text), and to verify that navigation and form validation worked as intended. The human-in-the-loop process involved carefully reviewing each page, testing form validation, and confirming that the user experience met requirements. Any issues found were corrected before final acceptance.

Where AI helped save time
AI significantly accelerated the creation of boilerplate HTML, CSS, and form validation logic. The assistant provided ready-to-use code for navigation bars, responsive layouts, and form accessibility, reducing the time needed to research and hand-code these elements. The ability to quickly generate and iterate on page structure and styling allowed for a more efficient workflow. In particular, the AI was able to suggest best practices for accessibility and responsive design, which would have required additional research if done manually. The time saved on repetitive tasks, such as setting up consistent navigation across all pages and ensuring uniform styling, allowed me to focus more on the content and user experience. Additionally, the AI’s ability to generate form validation logic and accessibility features meant that I could implement a robust contact form much faster than if I had written all the code from scratch. Overall, the AI’s assistance made the development process smoother and more productive, enabling me to deliver a polished website in less time than anticipated.

Where AI made mistakes
Occasional minor issues were found, such as missing alt text for images or incomplete validation logic in the contact form. These issues were identified during my review and testing of the generated pages. For example, I noticed that some accessibility requirements were not fully met, prompting me to add or adjust label associations and error messages. The AI sometimes required clarification on requirements, especially for more nuanced aspects of user experience or accessibility. In a few cases, the initial output did not fully match the project specifications, but these discrepancies were minimal and easily addressed through manual edits. My active involvement in reviewing and testing the AI’s output ensured that any mistakes were caught early and corrected before final submission, maintaining the quality and compliance of the website.

Balance of personal code and AI assistance
The majority of the code was generated by the AI, but every output was carefully reviewed, tested, and, where necessary, modified by me as the student. This human-in-the-loop approach was essential for ensuring that the final product met all requirements and maintained a high standard of quality. I took an active role in checking the AI’s work, making adjustments for accessibility, usability, and overall user experience. This process demonstrated an effective balance between leveraging AI for productivity and applying human judgment for correctness and completeness. By combining the speed and efficiency of AI-generated code with my own critical thinking and attention to detail, I was able to produce a website that not only met the assignment’s technical requirements but also reflected my personal standards for quality and professionalism. This experience highlighted the value of collaboration between human expertise and AI assistance in modern web development.
