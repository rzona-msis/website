# NEW
#=====================================
# 1. Get a variable from the URL
# 2. Look at alternatives to moving in and out of
#    a virtual subfolder
# 3. Move the HTML to functions so that the code
#    is a bit easier to read
#=====================================


# To run this program, you have to use FLASK
# Option 1: Name the file app.py or wsgi.py
# flask run

# Option 2: Name the file anyting you want and type (do NOT include the .py file extension)
# flask --app filename run

# Option 3: Run the app in DEBUG mode
# flask --app filename run --debug

# Option 4: Add the following to the bottom of the program and then type python3 filename.py in
#           the terminal to run the website
# if __name__=='__main__':
#     app.run(debug=True)


# 1.  Import the Flask library. This is a web framework (aka web server)
from flask import Flask

# 2. Bring in the datetime library so that we can run datetime code
from datetime import datetime

# 2. Create a instance of the Flask() class with the only parameter being
#    a "system" variable called __name__. If you want to see what is in __main__
#    create a new Python program file and print it and see what it prints.
#    Call the instance/object "app"
app = Flask(__name__)

# 3. We then use the route() decorator (aka function) to tell Flask what URL should trigger our function.
#    / means the root or "top" level
@app.route("/")     # Default page when you only type the Server URL
@app.route("/home") # Explicit name when you type the Server URL and the route name
# 4. Now letâ€™s tell the website what we should send to the person's web browser who visited our page
def hello_world():
    return getHomePage()

# 5. Create another route (aka page)
@app.route("/aboutme")
def secondPage():
    now = datetime.now()
    return getaboutme(now)

# 6. Create another route (aka page) but this time ask for a name
#    You can get values from the URL by adding <variableName> to the app.routes
@app.route("/Name/<name>") # NOTE: THIS WILL BE IN A VIRTUAL SUBFOLDER DUE TO IT HAVING TWO SLASHES \ \
def thirdPage(name):
    # NOTE: We use %s as the placeholder in the HTML text below and we can use that place holder to
    #       swap in variable names (i.e. name from above)
    #       We add another % at the END of the HTML text as well.  We use that to indicate which
    #       variable (i.e. "name") to swap in for the %s place holder IN the HTML
    return  getNamePage() % name
